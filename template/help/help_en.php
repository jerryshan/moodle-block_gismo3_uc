    <p>
        There are five areas which make up the LearnTrak user interface:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The dropdown menu navigation bar.</li>
        <li>The Item Type icon bar: Item types chosen from here can include students, groups, resources, books, forums, glossaries, wikis, quizzes and assignments.</li>
        <li>The List Panel: A list of students, resources, or activities in your Learn course will be shown in this panel. From each list the instructor can select or deselect data to visualize, for items chosen using the tick-boxes.</li>
        <li>The Graph Panel: Visualisations are shown in this panel.</li>
        <li>Time Slider: Using this slider the instructor can restrict the graph to display data from a specific range of dates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can target the student, resource or activity you wish to focus on, from the list panel before you chose the display type. This can be done by clicking on the item type from the icons in the Item Type icon bar, and selecting or deselecting using the instructions below. The system then only looks for data from those items and will display your graph much more quickly.
    </p>
    <img src="images/help/lists-help.png" width="306" height="275">
    <p>
        By clicking on the display options from the dropdown menus under the category headings along the menu bar at the top, graphical representations can be viewed with a focus on the student, the resources or the activities within a Learn site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dates of the information displayed can be made more specific by using the time slider along the bottom of the screen, which can be moved from either end.
    </p>

    <h2 id="options">Options &nbsp; <a href="#">[Back to top]</a></h2>
    <img src="images/help/options.png" width="447" height="375">
    <p>
        There are options available which allow you to customise the way you see LearnTrak, such as including items which have been hidden in your course, or changing the colours in which the graphs are displayed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="students-accesses">Students: Accesses by students &nbsp; <a href="#">[Back to top]</a></h2>
    <img src="images/help/students-accesses.png" width="500" height="330">
    <p>
        A simple matrix formed by students' names (on  the Y-axis) and the dates of the course (on the X-axis) is used to represent accesses to the course. A mark on the graph represents a particular student accessing the course at least once on a given date. 
    </p>
    <hr class="section" />
    
    <h2 id="students-accesses-overview">Students: Accesses overview &nbsp; <a href="#">[Back to top]</a></h2>
    <img src="images/help/students-accesses-overview.png" width="500" height="330">
    <p>
        A histogram showing the total number of accesses to the course made by students on each date.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coupled with the previous graph, this provides an overview of accesses made by students to the course with a clear identification of patterns and trends. You can also find information about the attendance of a specific student by using the tick boxes in the list panel.
    </p>

    <h2 id="students-accesses-overview-resources">Students: Accesses overview on resources, books, forums, glossaries or wikis &nbsp; <a href="#">[Back to top]</a></h2>

        Similar graphs are available for any books, forums, glossaries or wikis which you have in your Learn site. These can be viewed by choosing that item from the "Students" dropdown menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        By clicking on the "eye icon" in the left menu, you can see the details for a specific student. This will be displayed as per the example below.

    <p>
        By clicking on the 'Groups' icon <img src="images/help/groups-icon.png" width="23" height="23" /> you can see a list of all the groups and groupings in your course - both those created by teachers, and those groups created automatically.
    </p>
    <img src="images/help/display-groupings.png" width="500" height="330">
    <p>
        Groups display within their groupings, and those groups which are not in a grouping display beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see the data for one group of students, select that group by un-ticking all boxes, and ticking just the box for that group.

        Details of which resources were accessed by each student and when they were accessed are provided in this chart. Student names are shown on the Y-axis, with resource names on the X-axis. A mark is shown if the student has accessed this resource, with the colour of the mark determined by the number of times he/she accessed this resource. The colours range from green to red, or light to dark, depending on the option you have chosen. The actual number can be seen by placing the cursor on the mark. This also shows the maximum activity by a student.
